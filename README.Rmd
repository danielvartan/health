## Overview

`health` is an R package package that contains all my (Daniel Vartanian) health data. It represents a personal project that aims to monitor my body's expression over time and create a free public record for posterity.

## Installation

`health` is still at the [experimental](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental) stage of development, that means that people can use the package and provide feedback, but it comes with no promises for long term stability.

You can install `health` from GitHub with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("danielvartan/health")
```

## Health records

You can find the processed data (tidied, validated, and transformed version) in the `./data/` folder. The raw data is stored in the `./inst/extdata/` folder.

I try to update this repository at least once a year. Here's a list of all the health data present to date.

## Citation

If you use `health` in your research, please consider citing it. I put a lot of work into the collection, analysis and storage of this data, in addition to the work of building and maintaining a free and open-source R package. You can find the `health` citation below.
